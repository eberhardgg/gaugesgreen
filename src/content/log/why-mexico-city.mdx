After 15 years building products in Los Angeles, I moved to Mexico City. Not for the tacos (though they help). For the opportunity.

## The Thesis

A billion people in Latin America are online. Most are still doing business through WhatsApp and filing cabinets. The gap between how things work and how they could work is enormous.

I've spent my career finding those gaps and building products to fill them. ZipRecruiter was about the gap between how companies hired and how they should hire. JobGet was about the gap between how hourly workers found jobs and how they could find jobs.

LatAm has gaps everywhere. And unlike mature markets, you're not competing against entrenched incumbents with infinite resources. You're competing against inertia.

## Why Now

Three things changed:

**Remote work became normal.** I can serve US clients from anywhere. The 2-hour time zone difference to LA is nothing—I take calls in the afternoon instead of the morning.

**AI changes the math.** A tiny team with the right tools can build what used to require 50 engineers. That matters more in markets where venture funding is scarcer.

**The talent is here.** Mexico has world-class engineers, designers, and operators. They just haven't had the same access to capital and networks.

## What I'm Building

Gauges Green is two things:

**Advisory practice** for Series A-C companies, especially LatAm founders entering the US market. I bring the playbook I built at ZipRecruiter—how to find leverage, how to ship fast, how to make growth predictable.

**Product studio** building tools for the operators who think like me. Small tools that solve real problems. More on that soon.

## The Bet

I'm betting that the next decade of tech innovation won't just happen in SF and NYC. It'll happen wherever builders find leverage.

CDMX is where I'm finding it.
