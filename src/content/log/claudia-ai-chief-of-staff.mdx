## Hook

What if your todo app actually knew when to bother you—and when to stay quiet?

Most productivity apps treat you like a machine: rigid reminders, dumb notifications, endless pings. Claudia is different. She's an AI Chief of Staff who understands context, respects your time, and only reaches out when it genuinely matters.

---

## The Problem with Traditional Task Management

- Rule-based notifications are annoying (8 AM reminder whether you need it or not)
- Todo apps don't understand *why* a task matters
- No concept of "right time" to nudge
- Context switching kills productivity
- Most apps help you track more things, not do more things

---

## What Makes Claudia Different

### 1. Intelligent Chief of Staff Check-ins

Unlike rule-based systems, Claudia uses Claude to decide IF and WHAT to say:

- Evaluates your full context: goals, schedule, recent completions, missed blocks
- Asks itself: "Would a thoughtful human chief of staff text about this right now?"
- Knows when to stay quiet (this is the hard part)
- Messages feel like texts from a friend, not robotic notifications

**Good reasons to reach out:**
- Important task sitting unscheduled for days
- Time block just missed, could be rescheduled
- No ONE THING set for an active goal in the morning
- Celebrating a meaningful completion

**Bad reasons (stays quiet):**
- Just to "check in" with nothing specific
- User is clearly in a flow state
- Already messaged about the same thing

### 2. The ONE THING Philosophy

Inspired by Gary Keller's book. For each goal, identify the single most important task—your ONE THING—and protect it.

- Morning briefing helps identify your ONE THING
- Visual hierarchy: ONE THING > Next > Later
- AI helps you stay honest about what really matters

### 3. Goals & Roles Framework

Two dimensions of organization:
- **Goals**: What you're building toward (launch the product, learn Spanish)
- **Roles**: Who you need to be (founder, parent, friend)

Tasks belong to goals OR roles, never floating in limbo.

### 4. Time Blocking That Actually Works

- Named time blocks (Deep Work, Admin, Creative)
- Drag tasks onto your calendar
- Pre-block reminders, starting notifications, follow-ups
- Missed block detection with gentle rescheduling prompts

## Multi-Surface Experience

### iOS App (SwiftUI + SwiftData)

Native iOS app with:
- Full offline support via SwiftData
- Real-time sync with Supabase
- Push notifications via APNs
- Beautiful native UI

### Web App (Next.js)

Full-featured web interface:
- Drag-and-drop task management
- Day planner view
- Goal and role management
- Claudia chat interface

### CLI Interface

For terminal lovers:

```bash
claudia list              # List all tasks
claudia list one-thing    # Show your ONE THINGs
claudia add "Write blog post" -p one-thing -g launch
claudia complete abc123
claudia goals             # List goals
claudia onething          # Show/set ONE THING
```

Partial IDs work (first 8 chars). Direct Supabase access, no intermediate server.

### Siri Integration

Voice-first task capture:
- "Add a task to Claudia"
- "Create a task in Claudia"

Quick capture without breaking flow.

## Technical Architecture

### Stack
- **iOS**: SwiftUI + SwiftData + APNs
- **Web**: Next.js 15 + React 19 + Tailwind
- **Backend**: Supabase (Postgres + Auth + Realtime + Edge Functions)
- **AI**: Claude API (Anthropic)

### The Agent-Think Pattern

Every 30 minutes, a Supabase Edge Function:
1. Builds rich context for each user (goals, tasks, schedule, recent activity)
2. Sends context to Claude with Chief of Staff system prompt
3. Claude decides whether to reach out and what to say
4. If yes, queues a push notification

This is the key insight: **AI decides the "if", not just the "what"**.

### Notification Queue Architecture

Three cron jobs working together:
- `agent-think` (every 30 min): AI decides proactive nudges
- `time-block-reminders` (every min): Pre-block, starting, missed notifications
- `send-push` (every min): Processes notification queue via APNs

---

## Lessons Learned

### 1. The hardest part is knowing when NOT to notify

Easy to build a system that pings you constantly. Hard to build one that respects your attention.

### 2. Context is everything

A notification about a missed time block at 9 AM is helpful. The same notification at 11 PM is annoying. Claudia knows the difference.

### 3. Native apps still matter

For something you check 20+ times a day, web apps feel sluggish. SwiftUI + SwiftData delivers the snappy experience productivity apps need.

### 4. CLI is underrated

Terminal users are power users. A good CLI removes friction for your most engaged users.

## What's Next

- Daily review feature (end-of-day reflection)
- Pattern recognition (you always miss morning blocks on Mondays)
- Calendar integration (Google Calendar sync)
- Apple Watch complications
