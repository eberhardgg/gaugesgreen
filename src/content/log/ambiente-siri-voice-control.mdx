{/* OUTLINE - Expand into full post */}

## Hook
- Learning Spanish in CDMX, frustrated with existing flashcard apps
- Wanted something I could use while walking, cooking, driving
- Built Ambiente in a weekend—then added Siri control in an afternoon

## The Problem with Flashcard Apps
- Most require you to stare at a screen
- Can't use them during "dead time" (commuting, chores, exercise)
- Voice assistants exist, but no good flashcard integration
- The gap: hands-free, voice-controlled spaced repetition

## What I Built
- **Ambiente**: A Spanish flashcard app with full voice control
- Features that matter:
  - Siri integration: "Hey Siri, start my Spanish flashcards"
  - Lock screen controls for play/pause/skip
  - ElevenLabs AI voices for natural pronunciation
  - Swipe gestures to mark cards mastered
  - Memory hooks for harder vocabulary

## The Technical Innovation: App Intents + PlaybackController
- How iOS App Intents work (brief, accessible)
- The architecture: Siri → App Intents → PlaybackController → ViewModel
- Six voice commands: start, pause, resume, next, previous, "I know this card"
- Key insight: Background control without opening the app

## The AI Shipping Story
- Built the core app in a weekend with Claude Code
- Added Siri voice control in an afternoon
- The 3-person unicorn thesis in action: one person + AI = full iOS app
- Specific examples of what Claude Code handled:
  - Swift/SwiftUI architecture
  - App Intents implementation
  - State synchronization between Siri and UI

## What This Proves
- **Frontier operators ship differently.** The gap between "I want this" and "I have this" has collapsed.
- **AI changes the skill requirements.** You don't need to be an iOS expert. You need to know what to build and how to direct AI.
- **Small tools solve real problems.** I built Ambiente for myself. Turns out, a lot of language learners want the same thing.

## The Bet
- I'm releasing Ambiente publicly
- Part of the Gauges Green studio: tools for operators who think like me
- More tools coming: same philosophy, different problems

## CTA
- Try Ambiente (link)
- If you're building with AI and want to ship faster, let's talk
