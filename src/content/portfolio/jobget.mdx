## The Challenge

I stepped in as President during a critical moment. The company was burning through $2M per month with no clear path to profitability. We had strong market position but unsustainable economics.

## The Turnaround

**Cost structure overhaul** - Identified where spend wasn't driving growth and cut ruthlessly. This wasn't about layoffs—it was about eliminating inefficient spend that had accumulated during rapid growth.

**Revenue focus** - Shifted from growth-at-all-costs to profitable growth. Changed incentives, metrics, and priorities across the organization.

**Operational discipline** - Implemented systems for forecasting, accountability, and decision-making that the company had outgrown.

## The Results

- **Burn reduced** from $2M/month to sustainable
- **Revenue grew** past $100M
- **Laid foundation** for acquisitions of Snagajob and Seasoned

## Key Lesson

Turnarounds aren't about cutting—they're about focus. The cuts create space to invest in what actually works. Most struggling companies have a viable business buried under accumulated complexity.
