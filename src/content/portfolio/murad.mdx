## The Challenge

Murad was a respected skincare brand with distribution through Sephora, Ulta, and department stores. Ecommerce was an afterthought—a small team running basic campaigns with no real strategy.

## What I Built

**DTC as a growth engine** - Built the ecommerce operation from the ground up. Not just a website, but the full stack: acquisition, conversion, retention, and the team to run it.

**Profitable from day one** - Positive ROAS every single quarter. In DTC, that discipline compounds.

**25-person team** - Hired and developed a team that could operate independently and scale.

## The Results

- **#1 revenue channel** - Ecommerce became Murad's largest channel
- **25% CAGR** - Consistent growth year over year
- **Unilever acquisition** - The DTC foundation was a key part of the acquisition thesis

## Key Lesson

Building DTC for an established brand is different from a DTC-native startup. You have to grow fast enough to matter, but carefully enough not to blow up your existing retail relationships.
