## The Challenge

Most people either work or go to school. I did both—full-time—at Carnegie Mellon. This meant delivering production systems during the day while completing graduate coursework at night.

## What I Built

**Middleware and Database Development** - Managed the team responsible for core infrastructure that research groups depended on.

**Portal and Web Services** - Led the team building web-based tools for the university community.

**Research Systems** - Built systems that supported CMU's research mission across multiple departments.

## The Results

- **Two degrees** completed while working full-time
- **Three promotions** from programmer to manager
- **Foundation** in systems thinking that shaped everything after

## Key Lesson

Working inside a research university taught me to build for users who were smarter than me and had no patience for tools that got in their way. That standard stuck.
