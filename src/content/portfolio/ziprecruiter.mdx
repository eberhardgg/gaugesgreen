## The Challenge

When I joined ZipRecruiter in 2014, we had strong product-market fit but no scalable growth engine. The product team was three people. We were competing against Indeed, LinkedIn, and Monster with a fraction of their resources.

## What I Built

**The #1-rated job seeker app** - Held the top spot for 8 years. This wasn't about features—it was about deeply understanding what job seekers actually needed and stripping away everything else.

**AI-powered matching** - Built on billions of signals from our 110M job seekers. 80% of employers received a quality candidate within 24 hours. Cut time-to-hire from 39 days to 16 days by prioritizing quality over quantity.

**Invite to Apply** - This single feature 2.5x'd candidate flow per job posting. Job seekers who received invitations were 3x more likely to get hired. Instead of waiting for candidates to find listings, we proactively connected them with relevant opportunities.

## The Results

- **$100M → $900M revenue** over 7 years
- **NYSE IPO** in 2021
- **110M job seekers** and **2.8M employers** on the platform
- **80% of employers** matched with quality candidates within 24 hours
- **#1 job seeker app** maintained for 8 consecutive years

## Key Lesson

The biggest unlock wasn't a feature—it was shifting from "post and pray" to proactive matching. Most job boards optimize for employer convenience. We optimized for successful hires.
