## The Challenge

When I joined ZipRecruiter in 2014, we had strong product-market fit but no scalable growth engine. The product team was three people. We were competing against Indeed, LinkedIn, and Monster with a fraction of their resources.

## What I Built

**The #1-rated job seeker app** - Held the top spot for 8 years. This wasn't about features—it was about deeply understanding what job seekers actually needed and stripping away everything else.

**ML-powered matching** - Cut time-to-hire from 39 days to 16 days. We rebuilt the entire matching algorithm to prioritize quality over quantity, which counterintuitively drove more engagement.

**Invite to Apply** - This single feature 2.5x'd candidate flow per job posting. Instead of waiting for candidates to find listings, we proactively connected them with relevant opportunities.

## The Results

- **$100M → $900M revenue** over 7 years
- **NYSE IPO** in 2021
- **100K+ business customers**
- **#1 job seeker app** maintained for 8 consecutive years

## Key Lesson

The biggest unlock wasn't a feature—it was shifting from "post and pray" to proactive matching. Most job boards optimize for employer convenience. We optimized for successful hires.
