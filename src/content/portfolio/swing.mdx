## The Challenge

Swing connects schools with substitute teachers—a classic two-sided marketplace. When I joined, the matching process was heavily manual. Operations costs were eating into margins and making the unit economics unsustainable.

## What I Built

**AI-powered matching** - Replaced manual matching with an ML system that considers teacher qualifications, school preferences, location, and historical performance. The system gets smarter with every placement.

**Automated workflows** - Eliminated manual touchpoints throughout the booking and payment process. What used to require human intervention now happens automatically.

**Quality feedback loops** - Built systems to capture and act on quality signals, improving match quality over time.

## The Results

- **50% OpEx reduction** in one year
- **Sustainable unit economics** achieved
- **Faster matching** with higher quality

## Key Lesson

The best AI implementations aren't about replacing humans with robots—they're about encoding human expertise into systems that scale. The matching algorithm captured what our best operators knew intuitively.
