        <p class="text-sm leading-relaxed" data-i18n="about_text">
          Former Chief Product Officer at ZipRecruiter, where I helped scale the company from under $100M to over $900M in revenue through IPO. Built the #1-rated mobile app for job seekers, led user acquisition at scale, and opened offices in Tel Aviv, Austin, and Palo Alto. As President of JobGet, grew revenue to over $100M/year while cutting burn from $2M/month, putting the company on the profitability path that enabled acquisitions of Snagajob and Seasoned. Most recently as CPTO at Swing Education, drove end-to-end AI transformation that cut OpEx and COGS by 50%+ YoY while maintaining growth and product velocity.
