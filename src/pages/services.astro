          Series A/B companies a few quarters post-fundraise where growth or product KPIs are falling short of plan. Founders who want a fast diagnosis and hands-on execution, especially on the product and engineering side—and where those functions need tighter integration with GTM.

            <li>— Sub-scale teams where there's a talent cliff below the founder</li>

          I also work with later-stage companies facing similar challenges—my experience scaling ZipRecruiter through IPO means I'm comfortable operating at that level of complexity.

        <p class="text-sm leading-relaxed" data-i18n="what_text">
          Most companies I work with have a similar problem: product is shipping but growth isn't responding. I find the disconnect—usually between what's being built and what customers or GTM actually need—and fix it. I've helped companies double product velocity, cut burn by 50%, and unlock millions in expansion revenue by connecting product execution to the metrics that matter.
